# Welcome to the AstroInfo Hackathon 2025

Hello everyone, and welcome back for the **AstroInfo Hackathon Week (Nov 3–7)**!
Most of you were here last week for the school — great to see you again!
For the few new arrivals, welcome aboard 🚀

This week is all about **hands-on collaboration, creativity, and coding**.
You’ll work in teams to develop and polish scientific software projects —
and hopefully bring them to a publishable stage!

## Goals and Outcomes

Your **main goal**:
➡️ Reach the **minimum requirements for a JOSS submission**, and publish your code on GitHub.

If your project yields interesting results:
➡️ Consider extending it toward a **scientific letter, poster, or conference talk**.

We’ll also look for **volunteers to lead follow-up working groups**
to finalize promising projects beyond this week.

## Technical Points

* **GitHub main repository:** [https://github.com/astroinfo-hacks](https://github.com/astroinfo-hacks)
  ➡️ *Who needs an intro or reminder about Git and GitHub?*

* **Connection to the CC-IN2P3 computing cluster:** see below.

## Computing Cluster at CC-IN2P3

### Change your password

```bash
ssh <astropartXX>@cca.in2p3.fr
passwd
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

Access Jupyter Notebooks at:
👉 [https://notebook.cc.in2p3.fr](https://notebook.cc.in2p3.fr)

Documentation:
📘 [https://doc.cc.in2p3.fr/en/Daily-usage/jnp/jn-platform.html](https://doc.cc.in2p3.fr/en/Daily-usage/jnp/jn-platform.html)

You can choose **CPU or GPU nodes** when starting a new server.

For the hackathon, **3 machines with 12 GPUs total** are reserved.
These machines also have excellent CPUs — feel free to use them for both GPU and CPU-intensive tasks.

## Social & Evening Events

* **Monday 18:00:** Visit of the Observatory
  → Followed by **stargazing session** after dinner 🌌
* **Wednesday 20:45:** Café Science *(in French)*
  * “**My PhD in 5 minutes**” – volunteers welcome!
  * **AstroInfo Quiz** – propose your questions on Discord
  * **Round Table** – suggest discussion themes on Discord
* **Wednesday 13:30:** **Group Photo**, in front of the main building.

## Using AI Assistants Responsibly

You are welcome to use **AI assistants** (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or others) during the hackathon —
especially for:

* exploring documentation or libraries,
* writing boilerplate or refactoring code,
* generating or proofreading text (e.g., README, docstrings).

When you do, please **mention it explicitly** in your project documentation.
A simple example:

> “Parts of this code and documentation were drafted or refined using ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5), under the supervision of the project authors.”

Transparency about AI use is part of good scientific practice — and helps others understand and reproduce your workflow.

## Have Fun!

The hackathon is about **experimenting, learning, and building together** — not just producing results.
Collaborate, share ideas, and enjoy the process!

Let’s make this week both **productive and fun** ✨
